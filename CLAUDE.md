# Koder — Gas Town Crew Worker (kimigas)

> **Recovery**: Run `gt prime` after compaction, clear, or new session

Full context is injected by `gt prime` at session start.

## IMPORTANT: Rig Identity

This is the **kimigas** rig in Gas Town. The upstream project is **kimi-cli**.

- **Rig name**: `kimigas` (use this in all `gt` commands: `gt hook`, `gt sling`, `gt rig status kimigas`, etc.)
- **Upstream project**: `kimi-cli` by MoonshotAI — the `kimi` command references in README.md, docs/, and AGENTS.md refer to the upstream CLI tool, NOT this rig
- **Do NOT confuse** `kimi` (the upstream CLI tool you are contributing to) with `kimigas` (this Gas Town rig)
- Your worktree is a clone of the kimi-cli repo. Project docs describe the upstream tool. Gas Town operations use `gt` commands with rig name `kimigas`.
